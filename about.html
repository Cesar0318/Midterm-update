<h1> About Me </h1>
	<div id="box">
	<p> Most people probably learned in school that temperature is basically just a measurement of how vigorously particles in a system shake: A high temperature means lots of shaking, and absolute zero means absolutely no shaking. While this interpretation may work to understand the temperature in your oven, itâ€™s not the whole picture.</p>
	<p>For a start, temperature isn't simply the average energy of all the particles in a system. It is actually related to the distribution of those energies. Imagine particles as bricks in a building, with the height of each brick reflecting each particle's energy. At low temperatures, the building looks similar to a pyramid that is short and fat at the bottom. At higher temperatures, the pyramid grows taller and skinnier. This trend continues as the temperature rises, up to what's known as the "absolute high" temperature -- where the pyramid transforms into a single column, stretching from the ground infinitely up toward the sky. This is where things begin to get weird.</p></div>
